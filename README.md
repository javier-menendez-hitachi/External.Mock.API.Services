# .Net Core Minimal Mock APIs with Chaos injection
So, you have integrations with third-party API's, but the vendors don't always provide you sandboxes to all your test environments,
or the ones you have access to have limitations in load, availability, and performance.
In this presentation, we will show you how to use .net Minimal Api to quickly build and deploy mock APIs that are easily deployable into Azure Cl Cloud
and configurable with dynamic responses, rate gate limits, latency, and all that you need to load test and performance test your system.
We will also show how to test Reliability using the Simmy Chaos package for .Net in your minimal mock APIs.
